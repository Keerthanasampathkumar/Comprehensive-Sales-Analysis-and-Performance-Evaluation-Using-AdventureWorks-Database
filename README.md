# Comprehensive-Sales-Analysis-and-Performance-Evaluation-Using-AdventureWorks-Database
This project analyzes AdventureWorks sales data to identify trends, customer behavior, and product performance. Using SQL and data visualization, it uncovers key insights like top-selling products and regional sales. The findings help improve decision-making, optimize sales strategies, and enhance business performance through data-driven insights.
Comprehensive Sales Analysis and Performance Evaluation Using AdventureWorks Database

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and evaluating sales performance using the AdventureWorks database. The goal is to derive meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. SQL is used to refine the dataset, and Power BI is leveraged to create an interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

## Objectives

Identify sales trends and revenue patterns.

Analyze customer behavior and segmentation.

Evaluate product performance and profitability.

Assess regional sales distribution and market performance.

Generate actionable insights to enhance business strategy.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

Extracted and cleaned data using SQL, filtering only relevant columns for analysis.

Exported cleaned data as CSV files for further processing.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

Imported data into Power BI and established relationships between tables.

Processed data in Power Query (renaming columns, adjusting data types, and formatting).

Designed an interactive 3-page dashboard to visualize key insights:

Sales Overview - High-level sales performance metrics.

Sales by Customer - Customer segmentation and purchase behavior.

Sales by Product - Best-selling products and revenue contribution.

### Technologies Used

SQL – Data extraction, transformation, and filtering.

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation and reporting.

Python – Automation of data processing and visualization.

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Additional data analysis and visualization.

### Project Files

SQL script for data extraction and cleaning.

Power BI dashboard file.

PDF report of the final dashboard.

CSV files containing cleaned datasets.

Excel worksheet for additional data reference.

## Dataset Source

Due to file size limitations, the AdventureWorks Data Warehouse version 2019 (99 MB) is not included in this repository. It can be downloaded from Microsoft’s official GitHub:
AdventureWorksDW2019.bak

To update date columns, I used the script provided by TechTalkCorner:
